    "# Wind Speed vs. Latitude Linear Regression¶\n",
    "There seems to be a pretty strong correlation between wind speed and latitude. However, the linear regresion shows a much lower correlation than it appears. There is still a definite correlation in both hemispheres, in that the further you are from the equator (latitude 0) the higher the wind speeds are."
